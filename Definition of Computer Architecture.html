    <p style="color:white"> In computer engineering, computer architecture is a set of 
      rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems.
Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model 
of a computer but not a particular implementation.
In other definitions computer architecture involves instruction set architecture design, 
microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation.</p>
