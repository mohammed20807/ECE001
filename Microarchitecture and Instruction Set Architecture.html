    <td>Microarchitecture is known as computer organizations and it is the way when instruction 
      set architecture is a built-in processor. Instruction set architecture is implemented with
       various microarchitecture and it varies because of changing technology.
Microarchitecture performs in a certain way. It reads the instruction and decodes it, will find 
parallel data to process the instruction and then will process the instruction and output will be generated. </td>
     <td>o make up the architecture, instruction set architecture is needed because it has a set of instructions
      that the processor understands. It has two instruction set one is RISC (reduced instruction set computer) and the second 
      is CISC (complex instruction set computer).
Reduced instruction set computer architecture was realized in the 90â€™s by IBM. Instruction has multiple address modes, but programs 
do not use all of them that is the reason multiple address modes were reduced. This helps the compiler to easily write the 
instructions, performed is increased.</td>
